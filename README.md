- What was your experience?
  This was my first front-end project so it was kind of hard to get React hooks and life cycle but nothing as hard as making things stay where they should D:
- What have you learned/improved?
  All the basic React hooks and so flex styling
- Your wisdom? :)
  Use state + use effect + object can give you some headaches

Obs: My first little front-end project <3

### Built With
